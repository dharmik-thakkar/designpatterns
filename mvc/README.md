Model View Controller Pattern

Model
It consists of pure application logic, which interacts with the database. It includes all the information to represent data to the end user.

View
View represents the HTML files, which interact with the end user. It represents the modelâ€™s data to user.

Controller
It acts as an intermediary between view and model. It listens to the events triggered by view and queries model for the same.
